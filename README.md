# Analysis of Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Match Outcomes

This project analyzes **WTA matches (2023‚Äì2024)** to explore how player characteristics, match conditions, and statistics affect match outcomes.  
We combined datasets, performed preprocessing, visualization, and applied machine learning models to predict outcomes and player performance.

## üìä Project Description
The project merges WTA match datasets from 2023 and 2024 to:  
- Analyze player demographics, performance stats, and match conditions.  
- Train ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) to predict match outcomes.  
- Provide insights to improve training and match strategies in professional tennis.

### üìñ CodeBook
The following table outlines the key variables used in the analysis:

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description |  
|------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| match\_id | Integer | Unique identifier for each match |  
| tournament\_level | String | Level of the tournament (e.g., ITF, WTA) |  
| tourney\_date | Integer | Date of the tournament in Unix timestamp format |  
| winner\_id | Integer | Unique identifier for the match winner |  
| loser\_id | Integer | Unique identifier for the match loser |  
| winner\_ht | Float | Height of the winner in cm |  
| loser\_ht | Float | Height of the loser in cm |  
| winner\_age | Float | Age of the winner in years |  
| loser\_age | Float | Age of the loser in years |  
| surface\_type | String | Type of court surface (e.g., Clay, Grass, Hard) |  
| match\_duration | Float | Duration of the match in minutes |  
| first\_serve\_winner | Integer | Number of first serves made by the winner |  
| first\_serve\_loser | Integer | Number of first serves made by the loser |

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run the analysis, open Jupyter Notebook and execute the following steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries:

```bash 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

2. Load the dataset:
```bash
wta_matches = pd.read_csv('path/to/wta_matches_combined.csv')

```
3. Split data for model training and evaluation:
```bash
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = wta_matches.drop('match_result', axis=1)  # Features
y = wta_matches['match_result']               # Target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

4. Implement machine learning models:
```bash
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

5. Evaluate model performance:
```bash
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```
